ðŸ“¡ Project: External Pulse-Based Angle Decoder for STM32G0
This firmware is designed to interface with external systemsâ€”such as flight controllers (e.g., Pixhawk) or any device capable of generating PWM signalsâ€”and convert incoming pulse widths into angular values.

Upon receiving a PWM input signal (typically 1000â€“2000 Âµs), the system interprets the pulse width and maps it to a corresponding angle in degrees. This mechanism enables real-time control or feedback interpretation for applications such as:

Gimbal positioning

RC input signal decoding

Motion control synchronization

Angle feedback for stabilization systems

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Captures external PWM input via STM32 hardware timers

Converts pulse width into angle range (e.g., 0â€“180Â° or customizable)

Compatible with signals from Pixhawk or RC receivers

Lightweight and real-time performance using interrupt or input capture mode

Note:
This code is designed as a one-way decoderâ€”it does not control motors but strictly interprets incoming signals.
You may integrate it with your existing gimbal or control system to provide external manual or autonomous control input via PWM.
